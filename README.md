# goblin-spa: A minimal Vue.js Single-Page Application example

By Oleksiy Grechnyev.

While my code is inspired by [this example](https://www.adcisolutions.com/knowledge/how-build-single-page-application-spa-vuejs), I did things a bit differently. I used:

1. Modern (as of November 2023) Vite setup for Vue (`npm create vue@latest`)  
2. Composition API  
3. The native `fetch()` instead of `Axios`  
4. Bare minimal amount of CSS  
5. Semicolons in JS ;)  

Enjoy!


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
